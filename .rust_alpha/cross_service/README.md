# AWS SDK for Rust cross-service code examples 

These code examples in Rust use more than one Amazon or AWS service to perform a series of tasks.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several operations using the alpha version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

## Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

## Running the code

### detect_faces

This code example:
- Saves the image in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket with an "uploads/" prefix.
- Displays facial details age range, gender, and emotion (smiling, etc.).

```
cd detect_faces; 
cargo run -- -b BUCKET -f FILENAME [-r REGION] [-v]
```

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the JPG, JPEG, or PNG file is uploaded.
- _FILENAME_ is the name of the file to upload.
  It must have a __jpg__, __jpeg__, or __png__ file extension.  
- _REGION_ is the name of the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### detect_labels

This code example:
- Gets EXIF information from a JPG, JPEG, or PNG file.
- Uploads the file to an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Uses Amazon Rekognition to identify the three top attributes (labels in Amazon Rekognition) in the file.
- Adds the EXIF and label information to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

```
cd detect_labels; 
cargo run -- -b BUCKET -f FILENAME -t TABLE [-r REGION] [-v]
```

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the JPG, JPEG, or PNG file is uploaded.
- _FILENAME_ is the name of the file to upload.
  It must have a __jpg__, __jpeg__, or __png__ file extension.
- _TABLE_ is the DynamoDB table in which the EXIF and label information is stored.
  It must use the primary key __filename__.
- _REGION_ is the name of the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.


### Notes

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
